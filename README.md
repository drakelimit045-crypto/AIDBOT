# AIDBOT
AidBot is an IoT emergency robot combining a VEX drivetrain with ESP32 intelligence. It uses MQ2, flame, and DHT sensors to detect hazards, providing immediate response via an onboard fire extinguisher and first aid kit. Authorities monitor live ESP32-CAM feeds and data through a secure web dashboard for safer remote intervention.
